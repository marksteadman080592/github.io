1. What is Anki?:

Spaced repetition generally, helps you remember what you’ve learned, forever. Anki is a flashcard-based program that uses spaced repetition. It really works.

School and University involve learning vast amounts of information. As such, more and more students use Anki to maximize their learning.

2. School + Anki: Too Good to Be True? What Are Students’ Most Common Anki Mistakes?

Short Answer:

Anki has the potential for fantastic good. However, it’s not a cure-all. The three most common mistakes students make with Anki are:

Memorizing lists of facts without understanding the underlying concepts
Making cards on everything that “might” be useful
Not doing their Anki reviews every day

Detailed Answer:

Anki sounds amazing. When I first began, it almost seemed too good to be true. Like you, I was frustrated to learn things only to forget them days later. I decided to take the plunge and turn as much of what I’d learned into efficient Anki cards as possible.

My experience was remarkable. I’m more than 10+ years into my Anki “experiment” I started as an amateur poker player and can now speak three languages fluently and have managed to make a living out of my poker career:

Anki can: 
Make learning new things faster and more enjoyable
Making connections in my day-to-day much easier

on top of that it's completely free

- **Using Anki**, you can study on your smartphone/tablet and sync with your PC. On your pc anki is free but on your smartphone it costs a fair amount depending on where you live.
