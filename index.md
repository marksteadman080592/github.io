I make Anki flashcards mainly for chess but also for learning languages and scholastic education.  

Anki Flashcards are useful to

1. **Make more efficient use of your study time,**
2. **Train your intuition,**
3. **Focus on your weaknesses.**

- **Using Anki**, you can study on your smartphone/tablet and sync with your PC. On your pc anki is free but on your smartphone it costs a fair amount it is an open source tool and uses spaced repetition to enforce learning.

If you want to know more, i recomend you [check my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtbOM_nch2e7v9VShyQDNDA) up, there are examples of study sessions, and also some more theory focus videos, i explain Chess principles clearly and simply.
