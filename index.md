I make Anki flashcards (questions/answer), for get a better understanding of the equilibrium (**all come from piosolver**).  

Three goals: 

1. **More efficient use of your study time,**
2. **Train your intuition,**
3. **Find situations you are truly wrong to study them hard.**

I think the main key points i am doing better than others are : 

- **Using Anki**, you can study on your smartphone/tablet and sync with your PC. On your pc anki is free but on your smartphone it costs a fair amount it is an open source tool and uses spaced repetition to enforce learning.
- **Save time**, i made a complex [algorithm](https://blunderhunter.com/FAQ.html#How-did-you-choose-interesting-and-important-questions) to choose what to ask, only important and interesting questions. 
- **Show a lot of information in the answer to understand** better the situation [(and why you made a mistake)](https://blunderhunter.com/FAQ.html#What-am-i-seeing-caption)



If you want to know more, i recomend you [check my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtbOM_nch2e7v9VShyQDNDA) up, there are examples of study sessions, and also some more theory focus videos, i explain Chess principles clearly and simply.  

You can also look at the [FAQ](https://blunderhunter.com/FAQ.html) for documentation and common questions.
