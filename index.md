2. School + Anki: Too Good to Be True? What Are Students’ Most Common Anki Mistakes?

Short Answer:

Anki has the potential for fantastic good. However, it’s not a cure-all. The three most common mistakes students make with Anki are:

Memorizing lists of facts without understanding the underlying concepts
Making cards on everything that “might” be useful
Not doing their Anki reviews every day

Detailed Answer:

Anki sounds amazing. When I first began, it almost seemed too good to be true. Like you, I was frustrated to learn things only to forget them days later. I decided to take the plunge and turn as much of what I’d learned into efficient Anki cards as possible.

My experience was remarkable. I’m more than 10+ years into my Anki “experiment” I started as an amateur poker player and can now speak three languages fluently and have managed to make a living out of my poker career:

Anki can: 
Make learning new things faster and more enjoyable
Making connections in my day-to-day much easier

on top of that it's completely free

- **Using Anki**, you can study on your smartphone/tablet and sync with your PC. On your pc anki is free but on your smartphone it costs a fair amount depending on where you live.
